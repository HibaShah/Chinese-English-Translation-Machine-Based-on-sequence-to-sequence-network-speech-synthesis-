hello there,

here 3rd Experiment of Deep Learning. This is part 3 of all 3 parts, you can check my other repositries for other 1st and 2nd experiments.
All files of Experiment 2 are here

here is abstract of this experiment:

Abstractâ€” In this examination Tacotron-2 is talked about, it is utilized to produce discourse or voice like person and the cycle is known as discourse to-combination. It empowers client to integrate a characteristic sound discourse. This model produces Mel spectrograms from input text utilizing encoder-decoder engineering.
